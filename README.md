First things first, by the time I was using Google Notebook for certain reasons on my part.

# Dataset used
The dataset used to carry out this was a csv file downloaded from Kaggle.

# Purpose of the Project
This is a project aims to analyze the sebtiment distribution over the years across the three major platforms(Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)

To be fair, the above line doesn't really explain the purpose, so there you have it: This project tries to present visually among the three platfroms, which one over the years is the most used to express emotions, well sentiment(Positive, negative, neutral)

# Libraries used
The sentiment_distribution.ipynb contains different Python libraries used to make the analysis and the prediction. 

-Dash
-Pandas
-Numpy
-Matplotlib
-Plotly
-Scikit Learn
-NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

# Project Status

On my part, I guess I'll comeback to this project in the future but for now I guess I could declare this completed.

# Contribution

Anything that could be of help to me, I'm willing to learn either from positive reviews or any kind of criticism that could support my improvement through the whole process.

I have mentioned at the starting of this doc where I got the dataset and included the link. I'm forever thankful to Kashish Parmar for the dataset.


Well, Thanks.
